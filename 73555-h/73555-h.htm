<h1 class='x-ebookmaker-important'>BY ORDER OF BUCK BRADY</h1>

<p class='ni'><span class='upper'>Buck Brady</span> was always whittling.
Thin shavings were an
obsession with Buck. He would
sit for hours, tilted back in a
broken chair against the shady side of his
little office, knees almost touching his
chin, his long, thin face serious over the
task of reducing a piece of soft pine to
thin shavings.</p>

<p>Buck was the sheriff of Mojave Wells,
and Mojave Wells was a heat and sand
scoured, false fronted town in Road Runner
Valley. The town was invisible from
a distance, because even the painted signs
on the business houses had been sand
blasted until they were unreadable.</p>

<p>It was the end of the roundup in Road
Runner Valley, and Buck knew that before
night the town would be filled with
thirsty cowboys, whose overall pockets
were lined with money, and that when
whisky met cowboy there might be plenty
of work for the sheriff.</p>

<p>The first to arrive was Ben Dolan, a
thin faced, gaunt sort of cowboy, astride
a weary looking roan. Instead of heading
for a saloon, Ben dismounted in front of
the sheriff’s office, dropped his reins in
the dirt and sat down beside the sheriff.</p>

<p>“Hyah, Buck.”</p>

<p>“Purty good,” drawled Buck squinting
at his handiwork. “Whatcha know,
Ben?”</p>

<p>“Not much.”</p>

<p>“In kinda early, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>Ben made a few marks in the sand with
a lean forefinger.</p>

<p>“Had a reason t’ come in early, Buck.
Some of the boys said it wouldn’t do no
good, but I thought I’d tell you how it
was. ’Long about an hour from now Bud
Hickman will ride in. He’ll have his gang
with him and they’ll imbibe real freely.
Mebbe ’long about that same time Pete
Asher’ll ride in with his gang. They’ll
also imbibe freely, and some of ’em will
likely get kinda drunk. The boys are all
thirsty, you know. I expect it’ll be
kinda wooly around here t’night, Buck.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>Buck cut a particularly long shaving,
looked at it critically and nodded with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“You shore rode in early to explain all
this to me,” he said. “If you’re all
through, you might tell me the rest.”</p>

<p>“It’s thisaway,” explained Ben seriously.
“You know what a feud is, Buck?”</p>

<p>“Yea-a-ah.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what she amounts to
right now. And it’s all over a danged
girl!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad there’s a reason, Ben. Mostly
allus them feuds starts over nothin’. Go
ahead and tell me the details.”</p>

<p>“Rosie Smith.”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said. You know how
Bud and Pete kinda shined around her a
month ago. I don’t guess she knowed
which one to pick. Of course, Bud thinks
it’s him, and Pete thinks it’s him. And
there you are. It’s been kinda achin’
both of ’em, I reckon. Anyway, Chuck
Lester makes a remark the other night
that he supposed Bud wouldn’t be with
us in Mojave Wells at the finish of the
roundup, ’cause he’d stop along a picket
fence before he reached the main street,
and head straight through the gate.</p>

<p>“Pete was there, and I reckon it hit
him in a sore spot, cause he chips in with
a remark, which didn’t set well with Bud.
There wasn’t much said, but it took all
of us to take their guns away. We didn’t
want no killin’ in camp. Bud was reasonable.
He says to Pete, ‘We’ll settle this
in Mojave Wells.’”</p>

<p>“Pete was agreeable. He says, ‘That
suits me. We’ll make a truce until sundown,
both agreein’ to keep away from
her. When that sun goes down, all truce
is off, and we shoot on sight.’”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'><span class='upper'>Buck</span> sliced another shaving, laid the
stick aside and began whetting the
blade on the counter of his left boot.</p>

<p>“And one of them damn’ fools is goin’
to get killed,” added Ben.</p>

<p>“It’s kinda hard to git straight grain
stuff these days,” said the sheriff seriously.
“I ’member when I was runnin’ a
tradin’ post down Yuma way, I used to
git the best danged boxwood for whittlin’.
I don’t suppose it runs so good these
days.”</p>

<p>“Ben and Pete are both friends of
yours,” said Ben thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. I like ’em both.”</p>

<p>“A killin’ might start trouble. The
boys has kinda took sides.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose.”</p>

<p>“Bud and Pete are both good shots.”</p>

<p>“Yea-a-ah&mdash;purty good shots. Awful
damn’ fools in lotsa ways, but good
shots. Uh-hu-u-uh. Well, I’ve got to
write me some signs, Ben. It’s two hours
till sundown.”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d like to know about
it, Sheriff.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I do. Thank you kindly.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome.”</p>

<p>Ben took his horse and headed for a
saloon, while more cowboys came racing
in, their horses covered with lather and
dust. The sheriff watched the first contingent
arrive. It was Bud Hickman and
his gang from the Tumbling K. Bud was
a likable looking cowboy, about twenty-five
years of age, tall, lithe, swarthy as an
Indian, with curling black hair and a
white toothed smile. His crew was a
wild riding lot of hard bitted punchers,
ready for fun or fight at a moment’s
notice.</p>

<p>They noted that Pete Asher and the
J88 boys had not arrived yet; so they all
headed for the Desert Well Saloon, the
biggest place of its kind in Mojave Wells.
The sheriff stood on the edge of the sidewalk
for a while, cogitating deeply. He
had been sheriff of that particular county
for nearly two terms, which meant that
Buck Brady was pretty much of a man.
Finally he went into his little office, and
after a search he found an old paint brush
and a few ounces of almost dried paint
in a battered can. He kicked the ends
out of a soap box, drew out the nails and
sat down at his desk.</p>

<p>Pete Asher and his crew rode in from
the J88, tied their horses farther up the
street and entered the Prospect Saloon.
Asher was a heavily built, hard faced
cowboy, about the same age as Bud Hickman.
His hair was almost a neutral
shade, his eyes deep set and blue. There
was little to choose between his gang and
the one which came in with Bud Hickman,
and in numbers they were about
equal.</p>

<p>There were more outfits to come, but
they were not connected with the feud.
Rud and his men were at the bar when
the sheriff came in, and they greeted him
noisily. He was carrying a box end and
a hammer, and without any leave from
the proprietor he proceeded to nail his
sign to one of the walls. It read:</p>

<div class='tac fs09'>
FROM NOW ON EVERY MAN<br>
MUST TURN HIS GUN OVER<br>
TO MY OFFICE UNTIL HE IS<br>
READY TO LEAVE TOWN.<br>
BY ORDER OF<br>
&mdash;BUCK BRADY.
</div>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'><span class='upper'>Some</span> of the men laughed: some
swore. Bud Hickman strode over
to the sheriff and glared at him
belligerently.</p>

<p>“You tryin’ to kid somebody, Buck?”
he asked.</p>

<p>The sheriff looked steadily at Bud for
several moments.</p>

<p>“I ain’t in the habit of kiddin’ anybody,
am I?”</p>

<p>Bud flushed quickly, but he recognized
the fact that Buck Brady would back up
his sign. That was why Buck was their
sheriff.</p>

<p>“Kinda sudden, ain’tcha?” asked Bud.</p>

<p>“No-o-o. I’ve been thinkin’ this out
quite a while, Bud.”</p>

<p>“Is this the idea?” queried Bud. “We
all turn our guns over to you, and you
turn ’em back when we’re ready to leave
town?”</p>

<p>“That’s what the sign says, Bud; and
I wrote the sign.”</p>

<p>Bud laughed and turned to his men.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, boys. Shuck your guns.
I reckon we can stand it, if the others
can.” And then to the sheriff, “You
might have a little trouble with Pete and
his gang.”</p>

<p>“I hope they’ll be reasonable.”</p>

<p>The men put their guns on a poker
table, and the sheriff picked them up,
putting some in his pockets, some inside
the waistband of his overalls.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to remember your own
guns, boys,” he said.</p>

<p>“I reckon I can spot mine,” said Bud.
“I made them handles.”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'><span class='upper'>The sheriff</span> thanked them kindly
and went back to his office, where he
locked the guns in his desk. Then
he went over to the Prospect Saloon, where
he nailed up his other notice. Asher and
his men didn’t take so kindly to the idea.
Some of them were openly belligerent,
and it seemed for a few moments that the
sheriff had a tough job, but Asher took
the matter out of their hands.</p>

<p>“I suppose this thing only applies to
me and my men, eh?”</p>

<p>“You’re supposin’ wrong, Pete; I’ve
already collected from the Tumblin’ K.”</p>

<p>“You’ve collected from Bud Hickman?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I jist wondered. But suppose we
don’t give you our guns?”</p>

<p>The sheriff considered Pete calmly.
Then:</p>

<p>“I’ve allus liked you, Asher. You’ve
been a damn’ fool in lotsa ways, but
you’re jist human like the rest of us.
I’ve posted my notice, and I wrote it
myself.”</p>

<p>“But jist suppose we refuse to give up
our guns?”</p>

<p>“That,” said the sheriff calmly, “would
be jist too damn’ bad.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;” softly&mdash;“and if I should happen
to want to leave town, you’d give
me back my gun?”</p>

<p>“Jist like the sign says, Pete.”</p>

<p>“All right; here’s mine. Take ’em off,
boys. We don’t need ’em&mdash;now.”</p>

<p>The sheriff looked over the guns as he
deposited them about his person; he
walked out, swinging the hammer in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t that beat hell?” laughed Pete.</p>

<p>“I’ll betcha somebody told him somethin’,”
said a cowboy.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the idea of a moth eaten
old sidewinder takin’ my gun away,”
complained a cowboy who was new to
the country. “We’d ’a’ had some fun, if
we’d refused.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a sweet idea of fun,”
growled Pete. “That moth eaten old
sidewinder is jist thirty-two years old,
and if we hadn’t turned them guns over
to him he’d jist about ruined the whole
gang of us with his pet Winchester. When
you see ‘By order of Buck Brady,’ you
better read the upper part of it and act
accordingly.”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'><span class='upper'>All the</span> cowboys went back to
their drinking, and the sheriff was
forgotten, but both Bud and Pete
kept track of the sun. The sheriff, humped
in his chair, still whittling, saw Pete come
out, saunter to the hitching rack, where
he could view the sun. It was still an
hour high.</p>

<p>Ben Dolan, fairly well filled with liquor,
came over again and squatted on his heels
beside the sheriff. Ben was as hard bitted
as the rest of the cowboys, but he liked
both Bud and Pete so well that he hated
to see either of them wounded or killed.
And Ben was wise enough to understand
that both men would claim their guns at
sundown.</p>

<p>They saw Bud leave the Desert Well
Saloon, walk halfway across the street,
as if heading for a store, stop and look
toward the west. He too was keeping
cases on the sun. Then he turned and
went back to the saloon. Ben made
meaningless marks in the sand with a
forefinger, while the sheriff whittled
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“You shore collected a lot of guns,
Sheriff.”</p>

<p>“Yea-a-ah.”</p>

<p>“Almost sundown.”</p>

<p>The sheriff shut one eye and considered
Ben. Then he looked toward both
saloons, and went on whittling.</p>

<p>“The boys are gettin’ nervous,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“I notice.”</p>

<p>Several cowboys were standing in front
of the Prospect Saloon now, and one of
them essayed a clog dance. His boots
sounded loud on the old wooden sidewalk.
Another beat time on a porch post
with the end of a quirt. It was like the
beating of a tomtom, and he kept it up for
a time after the dancer had stopped. The
beater was swarthy, with high cheek bones.</p>

<p>Some of Bud’s gang came from the
Desert Well and stood around in front
of the building. One of them, a little
drunker than the rest, started across the
street toward the sheriff’s office, but the
others stopped him and, after an argument,
persuaded him to desist.</p>

<p>“It’s kinda sultry,” said Ben, rubbing
his forehead.</p>

<p>The sheriff nodded and looked at the
sun, only half of which was visible now.
He blinked from the strong light and cut
several shavings, which did not suit him
at all. A couple of dogs met in the middle
of the street; town dogs, fat and with a
friendship of long standing. But now
they growled ominously at each other, as
they circled, looking for an opening.</p>

<p>“Sic ’em!” hissed a cowboy from in
front of the Desert Well.</p>

<p>“Take him, Tige! Shake his fleas
loose. Four bits on the yaller one.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done made a bet, cowboy.
Choose him, Ponto.”</p>

<p>But the dogs only circled and growled,
and finally separated.</p>

<p>“Mebbe they’re waitin’ for the sun to
go down,” whispered Ben.</p>

<p>The sheriff shook his head.</p>

<p>“Got more sense than men have.”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'><span class='upper'>The sun</span> was down. Only the tip
was visible, and the crests of the
broken hills showed a golden highlight.
It was very still in Mojave Wells.
The shadows were gone now and the street
glowed with a yellow light, which would
not last long. Twilight was unknown in
Mojave Wells. Sundown, a streak of
gold, would quickly fade to blue, and
then darkness.</p>

<p>Bud Hickman came from the Desert
Well and went straight to the hitch rack,
where he untied his horse and swung into
the saddle. Simultaneously with Bud’s
move, Pete Asher came riding from the
rack beside the Prospect. It was not a
casual move. They intended to deceive
nobody, not even the sheriff of Mojave
Wells. The cowboys of both outfits were
in the street, watching intently.</p>

<p>Bud came straight to the sheriff, and
fifty feet behind him was Pete. Bud’s
face was grim, his mouth set in a thin
line.</p>

<p>“I’m pullin’ out, Buck,” he said softly.
“Would you mind handin’ me my gun?”</p>

<p>The sheriff stopped whittling, tilted
forward in his chair and got slowly to his
feet. He looked closely at Bud, but said
nothing, as he turned and went into the
office. Pete moved in closer, but he and
Bud ignored each other. Ben sighed and
leaned against the wall.</p>

<p>The sheriff came out, carrying a gun
in each hand. For several moments he
looked at the two men rather sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re pullin’ out, too,
ain’tcha, Pete?”</p>

<p>Pete nodded quickly and held out his
hand for the gun. They had been friends,
these two, until a woman had come between
them. Bud holstered his gun,
swung his horse around and rode slowly
down the street, looking straight ahead.
Pete accepted his gun, glanced at it to
see that it was fully loaded, snapped it
down in his holster and swung his horse
around, riding back to the center of the
street.</p>

<p>Ben swore softly under his breath.
Both of these men were good revolver
shots.</p>

<p>“Goin’ to be a funeral around
here&mdash;mebbe two,” he muttered. “Why
don’tcha stop it, Buck? Gawd A’mighty,
this ain’t right! Look at Bud&mdash;he’s
turnin’!”</p>

<p>“You didn’t expect he’d run away,
didja?”</p>

<p>The contestants in this desert town
drama were two hundred feet apart,
facing each other, both horses moving
slowly. They had both played a square
game. There was no advantage now.
Two hundred feet is a long shot. Both
men had drawn their guns. Bud’s horse
was dancing a little, and he spurred it
viciously.</p>

<p>Pete waited.</p>

<p>Ben’s hands were gripping the wall
beside him. He had seen gun fights
before, but they had all been unpremeditated
affairs. This one was too
much like an execution. The groups of
cowboys were as immobile as dummy
figures. Even the horses at the hitch
racks had ceased moving.</p>

<p>Bud and Pete were closing the gap
between them, closing it slowly, each
waiting for the other to make the first
move with a gun. They were only a
hundred feet apart now. It was close
enough. But neither of them made a
move to lift his gun.</p>

<p>Ninety feet; thirty yards. Either of
them could hit a tomato can at that distance.
Eighty feet! Horses walking
slowly, Seventy feet; sixty feet. Twenty
yards now. They were almost in front
of the sheriff’s office. Ben laughed foolishly.
It would be a double funeral. He
had seen Bud shoot the head from a
prairie dog at that distance.</p>

<p>“It’s a nice evenin’ for it,” said the
sheriff rather inanely.</p>

<p>And then it happened!</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'><span class='upper'>Both</span> guns came up at exactly the
same instant. Ben’s eyes snapped
shut and he turned his head aside.</p>

<p>Came a tiny ping, hardly louder than
the mere snapping of a revolver hammer.
Another and another. Bud’s eyes jerked
open. The two riders were thirty feet
apart, leaning forward in their saddles.
Not a shot had been fired.</p>

<p>With a swift movement, Bud Hickman
swung out the cylinder of his Colt and
emptied the cartridges in his hand. Every
primer had been dented. There were
marks on the bullets, marks made by the
jaws of a pair of pliers.</p>

<p>Pete was swearing viciously, as he
drew cartridges from his belt and started
to stuff them in his gun.</p>

<p>But the sheriff halted him with a sharp
word.</p>

<p>“Damn you, you pulled the powder on
my shells!” snarled Pete.</p>

<p>“Yeah; and I’ll pull somethin’ else out
of you, if you make one more move,”
said the sheriff calmly. “C’mere, Bud.”</p>

<p>Bud rode up to him, still holding the
empty gun in his hand. Pete had quit
trying to load his gun. They looked
coldly at each other.</p>

<p>“You boys hadn’t ort to fight,” said
the sheriff calmly. “Both of you goin’
off kinda half cocked, as you might say.”</p>

<p>The men from both outfits had moved
in close now, trying to understand what
it was all about, their enmity all but forgotten
in this queer turn of events.</p>

<p>“I pulled them bullets,” admitted the
sheriff. “I don’t reckon either of you
showed any yaller streak. You played
the game square, and I like you both for
it. Personally I kinda enjoyed it. It
was like lookin’ at a show. I was the
only one that knowed how it would turn
out.”</p>

<p>“Was it any of your damn’ business
how it turned out?” demanded Pete
hotly.</p>

<p>“In a way, it was, Pete&mdash;” calmly.
“Barrin’ my friendship with both of you,
and my position as sheriff, it still was my
business, in a way. Now, you two boys
was aimin’ to kill each other over a
woman. Yeah, Ben told me about it.
You might thank Ben instead of glarin’
at him.</p>

<p>“He liked both of you, and he didn’t
want no killin’ done; so he told me about
it. I don’t think for a minute that this
Smith girl would care to have you killin’
each other over her. Most girls don’t.
Anyway, it was a sucker idea, because
there ain’t no Smith girl around here any
more; so you was tryin’ to kill each other
for nothin’.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” blurted Bud.</p>

<p>“The Smiths ain’t moved away,” offered
a cowboy.</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t had so much killin’ on
your mind, you might have found out
that me and the Smith girl was married
over a week ago. You boys better go
back and have your spree, as soon as
you give me back them guns, ’cause I’ve
got work to do.”</p>

<p>“Whittlin’?” asked Bud blankly.</p>

<p>“Lookin’ for somethin’ to whittle on.”</p>
